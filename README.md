# Introduction to Robotics

Introduction to Robotics is a course I took at Bar-Ilan University as part of Computer Science (B.Sc) studies. The course was about theoretical computer science problems in the field of robotics.


## Description
In this repository you can find implementations in C++ of Krembots behaviors for ARGoS simulator.

**ARGoS Simulator** is a multi-physics robot simulator that can simulate large-scale swarms of robots of any kind efficiently. You can find more information about ARGoS Sim on ARGoS website https://www.argos-sim.info/.

**Krembot Simulator** is a physics-based 3D simulator for Robotican's Krembot robot. Original code by Elhay Rauper for Bar Ilan University and the ISF Smart Swarms center. Uses and modifies (and adds to) the Argos multi-robot simulator.

**Note:** In ARGoS, the software component that simulates a real robot is named Footbot. The Footbot version of Computer Science department in Bar-Ilan University is named Krembot.


## 3-Tier Architecture

3-Tier architecture (also named 3-Layer or simply 3T) is a basic robotic architecture that consists of 3 hierarchical layers that are Planner, Execution and Control, and another component that interact with every layer named Sensing.

- **Planner** - Responsible for mission planning in high-level while using heavy computations.
- **Execution** - "The Boss". Responsible for managing robot activity. Requests plan from the planner, and transmits commands to the Control.
- **Control** - Responsible for low-level actuators control and report the Execution for successes or failures.
- **Sensing** - Responsible for measuring states of the environments and the robot itself and optimizing sensing-data by modeling and filtering. Sensing information is transmitted to any layer that asks for information.


## Installation
1. **Prerequisite:** Linux OS. Simulation was tested on Linux Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS/Mint 18.4.
2. **ARGoS Core:** The core of the ARGoS Simulator. You can download it from https://www.argos-sim.info/core.php and install it.
3. **krembot_sim:** A physics-based 3D simulator for Robotican's Krembot robot. You can download it from https://bitbucket.org/galk-opensource/krembot_sim/src/master/ and install it according to the instructions written in the link.
4. **krembot_ws:** This is the workspace of the krembot. You can download it from this repository, or create one of your own by copying the directory "krembot_ws" from "krembot_sim" to a path as you wish.


## Configurations
An experiment is defined by _.argos_ files that are kind of XMLs that setting up the arena, its size, obstacles in it and other experiment preferences. For each mission/experiment/exercise, there is an _.argos_ file in the directory krembot_ws/config. The _.argos_ file is referencing C++ files that defines Krembots' behaviors.

To run an experiment use the command:
> $ argos 3 -c <_config_>
 
where <_config_> should be replaced by the path to the _.argos_ file that defines the experiment.


## Controllers
As was said before, Krembots' behaviors are defined by C++ files. A C++ program that defines behavior of a Krembot to perform a specific task is named "Controller". A controller usually contains a _.cpp_ source file, a _.h/.hpp_ header file, a _CMakeLists.txt_ file, and maybe other supportive files. Each mission/experiment requires a krembot's controller to make the krembots behave in such a way that they will fulfill their task. The controllers are located in "krembot_ws/controllers". Each experiments has its own controller, referenced by its unique _.argos_ file.


## Exercise 1 - Warmup
This exercise is a warm-up exercise only. It is designed for installing the working environment and making sure all the simulator components are working properly. As part of this exercise, me and my partner have implemented a simple controller code that causes the kremboot to drive straight and stop about 15 meters from an obstacle in front.

Configuration:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/blob/main/krembot_ws/config/ex1.argos

Controller:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/tree/main/krembot_ws/controllers/ex1

To run the experiment, navigate to krembot_ws directory, and run the command:
> $ scripts/run.sh warmup

In addition, it is recommended to make sure that the following controller examples are working properly:
> $ scripts/run.sh mixed_controllers

> $ scripts/run.sh porting_example

> $ scripts/run.sh run_away_by_bumpers

> $ scripts/run.sh run_away_by_bumpers_multiple

> $ scripts/run.sh sand_timer_test

> $ scripts/run.sh simple_demo


## Exercise 2 - Wanderbot

In this exercise we have implemented a coverage algorithm that let the krembot wander around randomly in strait lines until most of the arena is covered.

Configuration: 
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/blob/main/krembot_ws/config/ex2.argos

Controller:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/tree/main/krembot_ws/controllers/ex2

For the full report:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/blob/main/reports/Robotics_ex2_Report.pdf

To run the experiment, navigate to krembot_ws directory, and run the command:
> $ scripts/run.sh coverage


## Exercise 3 - Navigation with PRM

In this exercise we have implemented an algorithm that let the Krembot navigate from the starting position (1,1) to the goal position (-2,-2) using Probabilistic Roadmap, or PRM.

### Probabilistic Roadmap

Let's describe the PRM process shortly:  

Assume we are given a representation of the world by a grid of zeros and ones, where zeros represents vacant points and ones represents obstacles.  
<kbd><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72878018/154929046-56606068-257a-41dc-811b-4d2680f01351.jpg width=600></img></kbd>  

We would like to set our initial position and goal as S and G respectively  
<kbd><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72878018/154929374-48795410-19c3-47b6-bc70-25734d58f384.jpg width=600></img></kbd>  
Although PRM is better for general planning and RRT is a better algorithm for a specific planning.  

In reality (and even in the simulator), the robot is not a single point in space, but rather it occupies a certain area. But we still want to represent it as a point in order to use a shortest-path algorithm such as Dijkstra. Thus, we would like to inflate the obstacles using Minkowski Sum.  
For further reading about Minkowsky Sum technique: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_addition  
<kbd><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72878018/154930540-c14e22e3-adee-442a-a9f1-1f93b9d5758b.jpg width=600></img></kbd>  

Now, we would like to lower the resolution of the grid, as it is very large, and computations based on it may take a long time. A lower resolution grid can be sufficient.  
<kbd><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72878018/154931672-b975313c-97da-4f34-b6e2-9f232c85d76b.jpg width=600></img></kbd>  

Than we got:  
<kbd><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72878018/154931727-3584b9d8-5b40-4ae4-b3f5-a8594aa7267f.jpg width=600></img></kbd>  

Now, we need to sample N points and construct a graph whose vertices are these points and whose edges are any two vertices that see each other.  
<kbd><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72878018/154932025-28ead9e5-fa71-454f-89cf-684ae4d1d93a.jpg width=600></img></kbd>  
- Each point is inserted to a KD-Node.
- Than we can calculate Adj-Matrix using KNN algorithm and KD-Tree data-structure.

Now we can use a shortest-path algorithm such as Dijkstra (which is also recommended for efficiency), and get the following path:  
<kbd><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72878018/154932746-69285ae3-4dbf-418d-8bcb-e5360d311829.jpg width=600></img></kbd>  

And the results:

Configuration:

Controller:

To run the experiment, navigate to krembot_ws directory, and run the command:
> $ scripts/run.sh navigation


## Exercise 4 - Foraging Tournament

In this exercise we have implemented an algorithm that let the Krembot forage in an unknown arena without using its current position. We used this algorithm in an
Adversarial Foraging tournament where we competed with other classmates and won the 2nd place out of 20 teams. Our team number was 1. To improve our algorithm to a level it could compete in the tournament, we used the red team. That is, we have developed another algorithm that is supposed to simulate an opponent and compete with our original algorithm that is now called blue team. When the red team defeated the blue team, we improved the blue team, but when the red team won significantly, we turned it into a blue team and developed a new red team.

### Finite State Machine
The following FSM describes out foraging strategy:

**Presentation:** We had to present our strategy and red team to the class sevral days before the tournament, means we could change out strategy after the presentation. Here are the slides:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/blob/main/reports/Robotics_ex4_Presentation.pdf

Experiment's original configuration:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/blob/main/krembot_ws/config/tournament.argos

But for developing our algotirhm using red team we used a custom configuration:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/blob/main/krembot_ws/config/tournament_redteam.argos

Blue Team Controller:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/tree/main/krembot_ws/controllers/foraging_1

Red Team Controller:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/tree/main/krembot_ws/controllers/foraging_redteam

For the full blue team report:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/blob/main/reports/Robotics_ex4_Blue_Team_Report.pdf

For the full red team report:
> https://github.com/shlomi1993/Intro-to-Robotics/blob/main/reports/Robotics_ex4_Red_Team_Report.pdf

To run the experiment against a naive foraging algorithm, navigate to krembot_ws directory, and run the command:
> $ scripts/run.sh tournament

Or to run it against the red team, navigate to krembot_ws directory, and run the command:
> $ scripts/run.sh tournament r
